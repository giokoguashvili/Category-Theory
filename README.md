[Binary Operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation) on a set is a calculation that combines two elements of the set (called operands) to produce another element of the set.
 ops (○) = +, *, f()
 
[Аssoсiаtivе](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property) is a property of some binary operations.
