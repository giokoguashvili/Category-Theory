[Binary Operation] on a set is a calculation that combines two elements of the set (called operands) to produce another element of the set.
 ops (○) = +, *, f()
 
[Associative]
       (a ○ b) ○ c == a ○ (b ○ c)
       
[Commutative]
       a ○ b = b ○ a
       
[Semigroup] is an algebraic structure 
consisting of a set together 
with an [Associative] [Binary Operation]

[Identity element] or neutral element is a special type of element of a set with respect to a binary operation on that set, which leaves other elements unchanged when combined with them.
